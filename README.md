* __Algorithms:__
      <br>*In terms of algorithms, we managed to implement a graph by using 3 dictionaries - first dictionary was made for vertices, second dictionary was made for the edges that are
      going inside a specified vertex and the third dictionary was made for the edges that are going outside a specified vertex.
      We were requested to implement various functions that are considered a strong tool that contribute to ease for us the way we implement the whole problem - Directed               Weighted
      Graph Implementation.*<br />
     
* __Classes:__
      <br>*In terms of classes, we implemented a customized class for one node of a graph called Vertex, it has 4 attributes: Key - presents the number of a single node in a graph,
      EdgesGoingInside - a dictionary that presents the whole edges that are directed into the node, EdgesGoingOutside - a dictionary that presents the whole edges that are
      directed outside the node. In addition, we implemented the classes that we were told to implement - DiGraph & GraphAlgo that have their own interfaces. We worked according
      to their interface of course and implemented each function that existed in them interfaces.*<br />
      
* __Essential Functions:__
      <br>*The project has 5 essential functions:<br />
            <br>1) Shortest Path.<br />
            <br>2) Save.<br />
            <br>3) Load.<br />
            <br>4) TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem).<br />
            <br>5) Center.*<br />
       
* __Tests:__
      <br>*For every single function that was implemented in the project, we managed to make for them tests - which asserts if our work actually does work or not.*<br />
      
* __Graphical User Interface:__
      <br>*Finally, we were told to make a GUI and to check ourselves wether we are able to display each one of the graphs that were given or not.
      We used matplotlib in order to perform this stage, an easy-to-use built-in library in Python that provides such service. We have gotten 6 different graphs we had to             display.
      Named as the following - A0, A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5. We uploaded their displaying in the wiki, feel free to take a look at them.*<br />
      
* __Comparison:__
      <br>*Therefore, we have made a comparison regarding functions performances velocity between Python & Java.
      The following table illustrates the differences between the 2 languages:*<br />

* __How To Run:__
      <br>*We made our own customized main named in MyMain.py
      Simply press the run button of MyMain.py and it will display the whole graphs that were given.
      You can also take a look at the wiki, we uploaded each graph's display there too.
      Here is a sneakpeak of a single graph displaying as well:*<br />
